<h1>Introduction: Why Products Fail and How Lean Changes the Game</h1>

Building great products is hard. Most fail.

The reason most fail is because they fail to meet customer needs in a way that
is better than other alternatives. (product market fit)

The Lean Startup movement started by Eric Ries aims to Prioritize the product
market fit.

The Lean Product Process:
    1. Determine your target customers
    2. Identify underserved customer needs
    3. Define your value proposition
    4. Specify your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set
    5. Create your MVP prototype
    6. Test your MVP with customers
<h1>Part I: Core Concepts</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1: Achieving Product-Market Fit with the Lean Product Process</h2>

You have built a product that creates significant customer value. This means
that your product meets real customer needs and does so in a way that is better
than the alternatives.

    5. User Experience (UX)         (product) <-- Top
    4. Feature Set.                 (product)
    3. Value Proposition            (product)
    |
    |--Product Market Fit   
    |
    2. Customers underserved needs  (market)
    1. Target Customer              (market)   <-- Bottom of pyramid

The Market:
Starting at the bottom, the market consists of all the existing and potential
customers that share a particular customer need or set of related
needs.

The size of a market by the total number of customers in the market or the
total revenue generated by those customers.

Different customers within a market choose different solutions to meet their
needs.

Within a given market, you can analyze the market share of each competing
product.

Your Product:
A product is a specific offering intended to meet a set of customer needs.

For software, the product itself is intangible code, often running on
servers that the customer never sees. The real-world manifestation
of software products that customers see and use is the user experience
(UX), which is the top layer of the Product-Market Fit Pyramid.

To decide which features to build, you need to identify the specific
customer needs your product should address. In doing so, you want
to determine how your product will be better than the others in the
market. This is the essence of product Strategy

Product Market Fit:
Viewing product-market fit in light of this model, it is the measure of how
well your product (the top three layers of the pyramid) satisfies the
market (the bottom two layers of the pyramid).
