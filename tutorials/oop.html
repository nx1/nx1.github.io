<h2 id="chap1">Chapter 1: Object-oriented design (OOD)</h2>

While procedural programming follows a fixed sequence of steps, OOD models the
world as interacting objects with independent behaviors. This enables emergent
behavior without explicitly coding every scenario. OOD requires shifting
perspective from procedures to message-passing between objects. 

Software exists to fulfill a purpose, and efficient, enjoyable programming
aligns with cost-effective development. Object-oriented design (OOD) addresses
both technical and moral challenges by making code flexible and maintainable.
While a perfectly static application wouldn't require design, real-world
software inevitably changes. Changing requirements introduce challenges akin to
friction and gravity, making adaptability crucial. Well-designed applications
are easy to modify and extend, while rigid ones become costly and frustrating
to maintain.

Change is difficult because object-oriented applications consist of
interconnected parts that depend on each other. Dependencies make objects
resistant to modification, causing small changes to ripple unpredictably
through the system. Poorly managed dependencies lead to inflexible,
hard-to-test, and duplicated code. While bad design in small applications may
be manageable, as they grow, they become fragile and difficult to maintain.
Good design minimizes dependencies, making code easier to change, reuse, and
test.

Design is the arrangement of code within an application, and it varies between
programmers like an art form. Good design balances immediate functionality with
future adaptability, as the cost of change will eventually surpass initial
development costs. Practical design does not try to predict specific future
requirements but instead keeps options open. Its main purpose is to make future
design possible and reduce the cost of change.

Design is both an art and a science. While every programmer arranges code
differently, good design follows established principles that reduce the cost of
change and keep future options open. The SOLID principles, DRY, and the Law of
Demeter emerged from experience, but their effectiveness was later confirmed
through empirical research. Early studies measured object-oriented design
metrics in small applications, and later studies—such as those analyzing NASA
software—validated that well-designed code correlates with higher quality and
lower costs. Ultimately, good design isn't just opinion; it has measurable
benefits.

The Gang of Four (GoF) formalized common solutions to recurring design
problems, making software more modular, reusable, and understandable. Patterns
provide a shared language for developers, improving communication and
collaboration. However, misuse—applying patterns to the wrong problems—can lead
to overly complex code. While this book does not focus on patterns, it aims to
equip readers with the foundational knowledge needed to understand and apply
them effectively.

While object-oriented design (OOD) principles and patterns provide a strong
foundation, applying them effectively remains a challenge. Design is not just
about knowing the right principles—it requires skill, experience, and judgment.
The analogy to woodworking highlights that having good tools doesn’t guarantee
good results; mastery comes from practice. Well-designed software, like
well-crafted furniture, depends on the expertise of the creator.

ways design fails:

    Lack of Design:
    Beginners can write working applications without understanding design
    principles, but these applications become difficult to modify over time.
    Early ease leads to long-term frustration as changes break everything.

    Overdesign:
    Intermediate programmers, excited by their newfound knowledge, overapply
    principles and patterns, creating rigid, overly complex systems. Instead of
    allowing for flexibility, their designs become barriers to change.

    Disconnected Design:
    When design is separated from programming, often in rigid top-down
    approaches, it fails to evolve with real-world needs. Without iterative
    feedback, initial misunderstandings become baked into the system, leading
    to impractical implementations.


The key takeaway is that good design is iterative and must evolve alongside
development. Agile methodologies align well with this approach, ensuring that
design remains adaptable and responsive to real-world changes.

Good software design isn't about writing the most code or following arbitrary
metrics—it’s about ``minimizing the long-term cost of change'' while delivering
features in a reasonable timeframe.

<h2 id="chap2">Chapter 2: Designing Classes with a Single Responsibility</h2>

Common Questions in Class Design:
   - How many classes should there be?
   - What behavior should they implement?
   - How much should one class know about others?
   - How much should a class expose of itself to the outside world?

Simplicity is Key:
   - In the early stages, the goal is to keep things simple.
   - The application should work but also be easy to change later.  
   - Immediate functionality can be achieved through brute force,
     but ease of change is more challenging and requires thoughtful design.  
   - Easy changeability is what separates good programming from functional programming.
     It involves skill, experience, and a bit of creativity.

Creating Easy-to-Change Applications:
   - Making an application easy to change requires knowledge of design
     principles that promote flexibility and maintainability.
   - By understanding and applying them, one can structure classes to be both
     functional now and flexible in the future.


Deciding What Belongs in a Class:

When designing an object-oriented application, one is faced with the
challenge of deciding what should belong in each class. 

While the implementation of the application might be clear, the organizational
structure is what often proves difficult.

The focus on grouping methods into classes and making these decisions in a
way that allows for future flexibility.

Grouping Methods into Classes:

- The classes defined will shape how you and others perceive and interact with
  the code. They set the boundaries for how functionality is structured, and they
  can potentially constrain future development.

- Perfect organization isn’t expected at the start. Design is a balance between
  the current needs and the potential future changes.

- Preserving flexibility is more critical than achieving a perfect structure at
  the outset. Good design allows for easy changesin the future, even when initial
  choices are inevitably wrong.

Organizing Code for Easy Changes:
The goal is to create code that is easy to change when needed.

Easy to change means:
- No unexpected side effects from changes
- Small changes lead to proportionally small code modifications
- Code is reusable in new contexts
- The easiest way to change code is to add new code that is also easy to change

The mnemonic TRUE (Transparent, Reasonable, Usable, Exemplary):

  Transparent: The consequences of any change should be clear both in the code
  that is changing and in the code that relies on it.

  Reasonable: The cost of any change should be proportional to the benefit it
  provides. Avoid over-engineering or making changes that are costly without
  significant advantages.

  Usable: Existing code should be adaptable and usable in unexpected or new
  contexts without requiring significant rewrites.

  Exemplary: The code should encourage future developers to maintain these
  qualities, making it easy to modify in the future.


#### **Key Takeaway**
The first step towards creating a **TRUE** codebase is to ensure that **each class has a single, well-defined responsibility**. This is foundational for both current functionality and future flexibility. By adhering to this principle, you can make your design more **flexible** and **easy to change** as the project evolves.

<h3 id="srp">Creating Classes That Have a Single Responsibility</h3>

On a bicycle, the gear ratio is:
<pre><code class="language-python">gear_ratio = N_chainring / N_cog</code></pre>
Nouns like "bicycle" and "gear" are candidates for classes, but while "bicycle"
lacks specific behavior, "gear" involves data and behavior (chainrings, cogs,
and ratios), making it suitable for a class.
<pre><code class="language-python">class Gear:
    def __init__(self, chainring, cog):
        self.chainring = chainring
        self.cog = cog

    def ratio(self):
        return self.chainring / float(self.cog)

print(Gear(52, 11).ratio()) # 4.72727272727273
print(Gear(30, 27).ratio()) # 1.11111111111111
</code></pre>

Your cyclist friend requests an enhancement to the Gear calculator. She has two
bikes with the same gearing but different wheel sizes, and wants to account for
the impact of wheel size on the calculation. Larger wheels cover more distance
with each rotation compared to smaller ones. To address this, you need to
calculate "gear inches," which combines both the gear ratio and wheel size
using the formula:

**gear inches = wheel diameter * gear ratio**

Where:
- **wheel diameter = rim diameter + twice the tire diameter**. 

This allows cyclists to compare bikes with different wheel sizes based on their
gearing and wheel size together.
