<h3>Possible Outcomes for 2 Events:</h3>
1 event either can or cannot occur:
\( A \ \mathrm{or} \ \neg A \)  
The probability of this is:
\( P(A) = 1 - P(\neg A) \le 1\)  
2 events have 4 outcomes (joint probabilities/intersections):
\( A \cap B \ , \  \neg A \cap B  \ , \ A \cap \neg B  \ , \ \neg A \cap \neg B \)
The joint probabilities are given by:
\( P(A \cap B) \ , \  P(\neg A \cap B) \ , \ P(A \cap \neg B) \ , \ P(\neg A \cap \neg B) \)

<h3>Conditional Probability</h3>
Probability of A given B:  \( P(A | B) \) Conditional probability represents the probability of event A happening under the condition that B has already happened.
Marginal probability of A: \( P(A) = P(A \cap B) + P(A \cap \neg B) \)
Marginal probability of B: \( P(B) = P(A \cap B) + P(\neg A \cap B) \)

<h3>Derivation of Bayes Theorem for Discrete Events</h3>
Events A & B:
\( A, \ B \) 
Priors of A & B:
\( P(A), \ P(B) \) 
Joint Probability of A and B:
\( P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) \) 
Bayes Theorem:
\( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \)
<hr>
<h3>Bayes Theorem Example</h3>
\( P(D|T) = \frac{P(T|D) \cdot P(D)}{P(T)} \)
Priors of having a disease & not having a disease:    \( P(D) = 0.01 \ \ \ \ P(\neg D) = 0.99   \) 
Probability of Testing Positive Given Disease:        \( P(T|D) = 0.95 \) 
Probability of Testing Positive Given No Disease:     \( P(T|\neg D) = 0.05 \) 
Total Probability of Testing Positive:                \( P(T) = (0.95 \cdot 0.01) + (0.05 \cdot 0.99) = 0.0095 + 0.0495 = 0.059 \) 
Posterior Probability of Disease Given Positive Test: \( P(D|T) = \frac{0.95 \cdot 0.01}{0.059} = \frac{0.0095}{0.059} \approx 0.161 \)
