Part I:
<h2>Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable & Maintainable Applications</h2>

Data may be accessed and stored in a multitude of different ways. The umbrella
term Data Systems is a catch all for anything from databases, caches, queues,
etc... An application may use many differnet data systems together.

A major concern for software is that it is:
Reliable     : System works correctly in the face of adversity (software/hardware/human)
Scalable     : As the system grows, there should be ways to deal with it
Maintainable : Many people should be able to maintain and adapt the system productively.

<h2>Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages</h2>

Data models are crucial to software development because they shape how problems
are represented and solved. 

Applications typically involve layers of data modeling, starting from
real-world concepts (like people or actions), moving through general-purpose
models (like JSON, tables, or graphs), down to how data is physically stored
and processed.

Each data model layer abstracts the complexity of the one beneath it, allowing
different stakeholders (e.g., app developers and database engineers) to
collaborate effectively. However, every model comes with trade-offs—certain
operations are easy, others are hard or inefficient—so selecting the right
model is vital.

General-purpose data models used for storage and querying are 
relational, document, and graph models. These are often accesse using
differnet query languages.



<h2>Relational Model Versus Document Model</h2>
SQL is the best known data model, it based on the relational model introduced
1970, it organizes data into tables (relations) of rows (tuples).

Despite changes in computing power and application diversity, relational
databases have remained widely applicable and are still heavily used across
modern web services and applications.

<h2>NoSQL</h2>

NoSQL emerged in the 2010s as a reaction to the limitations of relational
databases, especially in web startups. Although the term started as a Twitter
hashtag in 2009, it quickly gained traction and now refers to a variety of
nonrelational, often open-source, distributed databases. 

Key drivers for NoSQL adoption include:
- Need for scalability (handling large datasets or high write throughput)
- Preference for open-source tools
- Use cases not well served by the relational model
- Desire for flexible, dynamic schemas

Rather than replacing relational databases entirely, NoSQL promotes "polyglot
persistence": using different types of databases for different needs within the
same application ecosystem.

<h2>The Object-Relational Mismatch</h2>

Data in OOP languages and SQL are structured differently, data stored in
relational tables therefore require an awkward translation layer.

i. A term borrowed from electronics. Every electric circuit has a certain impedance (resistance to alternating
current) on its inputs and outputs. When you connect one circuit’s output to another one’s input, the power
transfer across the connection is maximized if the output and input impedances of the two circuits match. An
impedance mismatch can lead to signal reflections and other troubles.
application code and the database model of tables, rows, and columns. The discon‐
nect between the models is sometimes called an impedance mismatch.i
Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like ActiveRecord and Hibernate
reduce the amount of boilerplate code required for this translation layer, but they
can’t completely hide the differences between the two models.
For example, Figure 2-1 illustrates how a résumé (a LinkedIn profile) could be
expressed in a relational schema. The profile as a whole can be identified by a unique
identifier, user_id. Fields like first_name and last_name appear exactly once per
user, so they can be modeled as columns on the users table. However, most people
have had more than one job in their career (positions), and people may have varying
numbers of periods of education and any number of pieces of contact information.
There is a one-to-many relationship from the user to these items, which can be repre‐
sented in various ways:
• In the traditional SQL model (prior to SQL:1999), the most common normalized
representation is to put positions, education, and contact information in separate
tables, with a foreign key reference to the users table, as in Figure 2-1.
• Later versions of the SQL standard added support for structured datatypes and
XML data; this allowed multi-valued data to be stored within a single row, with
support for querying and indexing inside those documents. These features are
supported to varying degrees by Oracle, IBM DB2, MS SQL Server, and Post‐
greSQL [6, 7]. A JSON datatype is also supported by several databases, including
IBM DB2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL [8].
• A third option is to encode jobs, education, and contact info as a JSON or XML
document, store it on a text column in the database, and let the application inter‐
pret its structure and content. In this setup, you typically cannot use the database
to query for values inside that encoded column.

For a data structure like a résumé, which is mostly a self-contained document, a JSON
representation can be quite appropriate: see Example 2-1. JSON has the appeal of
being much simpler than XML. Document-oriented databases like MongoDB [9],
RethinkDB [10], CouchDB [11], and Espresso [12] support this data model.

Some developers feel that the JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch between
the application code and the storage layer. However, as we shall see in Chapter 4,
there are also problems with JSON as a data encoding format. The lack of a schema is
often cited as an advantage; we will discuss this in “Schema flexibility in the docu‐
ment model” on page 39.
The JSON representation has better locality than the multi-table schema in
Figure 2-1. If you want to fetch a profile in the relational example, you need to either
perform multiple queries (query each table by user_id) or perform a messy multi-
way join between the users table and its subordinate tables. In the JSON representa‐
tion, all the relevant information is in one place, and one query is sufficient.
The one-to-many relationships from the user profile to the user’s positions, educa‐
tional history, and contact information imply a tree structure in the data, and the
JSON representation makes this tree structure explicit (see Figure 2-2).
