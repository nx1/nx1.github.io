Part I:
<h2>Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable & Maintainable Applications</h2>

Data may be accessed and stored in a multitude of different ways. The umbrella
term Data Systems is a catch all for anything from databases, caches, queues,
etc... An application may use many differnet data systems together.

A major concern for software is that it is:
Reliable     : System works correctly in the face of adversity (software/hardware/human)
Scalable     : As the system grows, there should be ways to deal with it
Maintainable : Many people should be able to maintain and adapt the system productively.

<h2>Chapter 2: Data Models and Query Languages</h2>

Data models are crucial to software development because they shape how problems
are represented and solved. 

Applications typically involve layers of data modeling, starting from
real-world concepts (like people or actions), moving through general-purpose
models (like JSON, tables, or graphs), down to how data is physically stored
and processed.

Each data model layer abstracts the complexity of the one beneath it, allowing
different stakeholders (e.g., app developers and database engineers) to
collaborate effectively. However, every model comes with trade-offs—certain
operations are easy, others are hard or inefficient—so selecting the right
model is vital.

General-purpose data models used for storage and querying are 
relational, document, and graph models. These are often accesse using
differnet query languages.



<h2>Relational Model Versus Document Model</h2>
SQL is the best known data model, it based on the relational model introduced
1970, it organizes data into tables (relations) of rows (tuples).

Despite changes in computing power and application diversity, relational
databases have remained widely applicable and are still heavily used across
modern web services and applications.

<h2>NoSQL</h2>

NoSQL emerged in the 2010s as a reaction to the limitations of relational
databases, especially in web startups. Although the term started as a Twitter
hashtag in 2009, it quickly gained traction and now refers to a variety of
nonrelational, often open-source, distributed databases. 

Key drivers for NoSQL adoption include:
- Need for scalability (handling large datasets or high write throughput)
- Preference for open-source tools
- Use cases not well served by the relational model
- Desire for flexible, dynamic schemas

Rather than replacing relational databases entirely, NoSQL promotes "polyglot
persistence": using different types of databases for different needs within the
same application ecosystem.

<h2>The Object-Relational Mismatch</h2>

Data in OOP languages and SQL have different structures, this implies that some kind
of translation layer is required between the application code and database.

Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like ActiveRecord and Hibernate help
reduce the boilerplate but cannot completely hide the differences between the
models.

Imagine storing a CV:
    - user_id
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - positions <-- there can be a variable number of these

This one-to-many relationship, would traditionally be stored in a seperate table
with a foreign key to the users table.
    Positions:
    - position_name
    - user_id <-- foreign key

Later versions of SQL added support for structured datatypes and XML data,
allowing for multi-valued data to be stored in a single row. These
features have varying support. 

A third option is to encode jobs, education and contact info as JSON or XML.
and store it on a text column in the database. This has the problem of not
being able to query for values inside the column. (why would you do this)

For a data structure like a résumé, which is mostly a self-contained document,
a JSON representation can be quite appropriate:
   
<pre><code class="language-SQL">{"user_id"    :  251,
"first_name"  : "Bill",
"last_name"   : "Gates",
"summary"     : "Co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates... Active blogger.",
"region_id"   : "us:91",
"industry_id" : 131,
"photo_url"   : "/p/7/000/253/05b/308dd6e.jpg",
"positions": [
    {"job_title": "Co-chair", "organization": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"},
    {"job_title": "Co-founder, Chairman", "organization": "Microsoft"}
    ],
"education": [
    {"school_name": "Harvard University", "start": 1973, "end": 1975},
    {"school_name": "Lakeside School, Seattle", "start": null, "end": null}
    ],
"contact_info": {
    "blog": "http://thegatesnotes.com", 
    "twitter": "http://twitter.com/BillGates"}
}
</code></pre>
- JSON may reduce the mismatch between the application code storage.
- JSON representation has better locality than the multi-table schema 
- The one-to-many relationships imply a tree structure in the data.

<h2>Many-to-One & One-to-many relationships</h2>
Using IDs instead of plaintext gives:
    - consistency     - easier updates
    - localization    - better search capabilities

This practice is part of "normalization", where human-readable values are
stored in one place and referenced by ID elsewhere.

Relational databases handle many-to-one and many-to-many relationships well
using joins, making normalization natural.

Document databases (like MongoDB) don’t support joins easily, so such
relationships are harder to manage. You often have to handle joins in the
application code, which can be cumbersome.

Although document models work well for tree-like, one-to-many data (like
résumés), data becomes more interconnected as features are added. For example,
turning "organization" or "school_name" into referenceable entities with their
own pages, or supporting "recommendations" that must reflect updates (like
profile photo changes). These growing relationships suggest that document
models may become limiting over time, especially without strong join support.

<h2>Are Document Databases Repeating History?</h2>
Hierarchical models like JSON work well for one-to-many relationships but
struggles with many-to-many relationships. This leads to either duplicating
data or manually handle references between records.

These limitations mirror the challenges faced with modern document databases.
The same issues led to the rise of new data models in the 1970s: the relational
model (which evolved into SQL and became dominant) and the network model (which
eventually faded). The longstanding debate over the best way to represent
relationships in databases remains relevant today.
<h3>The Network Model and the Rise of the Relational Model</h3>
The network model, extends the hierarchical model by allowing records to have
multiple parents, enabling many-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

Rather than using foreign keys, it used pointer-like links between records, and
queries followed fixed access paths like a linked list traversal. This gave
fine control over performance, but made the system inflexible and complex to
work with, especially when access paths needed to change.

In contrast, the relational model introduced a simpler structure: data was
stored in tables (relations), with rows (tuples) and columns. There were no
access paths—data could be queried freely using arbitrary conditions. The heavy
lifting of choosing access paths was delegated to a query optimizer, making
queries much easier to write and maintain. This flexibility allowed the
relational model to scale better as applications evolved.
<h3>Document Databases Comparison</h3>
Document databases resemble the hierarchical model by nesting related data
within parent documents. While this works well for one-to-many relationships,
many-to-one and many-to-many relationships are still handled via identifiers
(document references), much like foreign keys in relational databases. However,
document databases do not follow the complex pointer system of CODASYL and have
not adopted its model for handling relationships.

<h2>Relational Versus Document Databases Today</h2>
The differences between relational and document databases extend beyond
fault-tolerance and concurrency to their underlying data models.
<h3>Schema Flexibility and Application Code</h3>
Document databases offer schema flexibility, meaning they use a schema-on-read
approach which allows for dynamic, loosely structured data. This can simplify
the code when dealing with document-like, nested data that is usually loaded in
one go. However, if the data is highly interconnected or involves many-to-many
relationships, the document model may require denormalization or complex
application-level joins, potentially complicating code and hurting performance.
<h3>Support for Joins and Complex Relationships</h3>
Relational databases naturally support joins, making them better suited for
many-to-one and many-to-many relationships. Their schema-on-write approach
enforces consistency and often leads to cleaner handling of interconnected data
compared to the document model, where related items are typically referenced by
unique identifiers and must be joined through additional queries.
<h3>Data Locality for Queries</h3>
Document databases store an entire document as one continuous block, providing
performance benefits when most of a document is frequently accessed together.
This locality can reduce disk seeks compared to relational databases that
spread data across multiple tables. However, this benefit may turn into a
drawback if only small portions of a document are needed, as the entire
document still must be loaded and updated.
<h3>Convergence of Data Models</h3>
The gap between document and relational databases is closing. Relational
databases now support JSON and XML, enabling them to handle document-like data.
Document databases are beginning to introduce features like join-like
operations. This convergence means that hybrid approaches can provide the best
of both worlds, allowing applications to leverage the strengths of each model
as needed.

<h2>Query Languages for Data</h2>
Declarative query languages like SQL, are inspired by relational algebra. In
contrast to imperative programming, You need only to simply state the
conditions that the results must satisfy, letting the database engine decide
the best way to execute the query.

<strong>Conciseness and Simplicity:</strong>
Queries specify the desired result pattern rather than the processing
algorithm, resulting in more concise code.

<strong>Implementation Abstraction:</strong>
The database engine’s query optimizer handles the execution details (e.g.,
index selection and join order), which enables improvements without changing
the query.

<strong>Parallel Execution:</strong>
Declarative queries can be more readily parallelized because they do not depend
on a specific order of operations, taking advantage of multi-core and
distributed computing environments.
