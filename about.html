<h1>nx1.info | About</h1>
<h3>Where am I and what is this place?</h3>

Welcome weary traveller, relax, rest your eyes and clear your mind... and have
a shower, jesus.

You have been drifting through the sea of shit that is the internet in 2025,
but the currents have been kind to you and have ashore at nx1.info.

What's that? You feel funny? Don't worry that's normal. Here you are free from
the tracking tethers, surveillance straps, cookie collars and algorithmic
attention anchors that have penetrated every corner of the web. It takes some
time to get used to it... 

Not many travellers wash up to these shores, if you're here, it's because I
told you about this site, or you stumbled upon it through sheer luck or maybe a
CV link, an obscure forum post, or some arcane internet magic. Either way, you
didn’t get here because an algorithm decided you should. Well done.

Enjoy your stay, and remember: if this feels like a breath of fresh air, it’s
only because the rest of the web has become a landfill.
