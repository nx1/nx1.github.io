Get Product of all other elements
---------------------------------
Input:
[1,2,3,4,5]

Output:
[20,60,40,30,24]

The reccomended solution proposes to precompute results from subarrays and
build up a solution from these results.

That is to say, for the given value a[i] we obtain all the values from
a[0]   to a[i-1] : prefix products
a[i+1] to a[-1]  : suffix products

Then we go over these prefix and suffix products to calculate the desired
results.

The benefit of this over my initial solution is that you do not need to iterate
over the initial array len(array) times calculating the products so it is
faster.
