Find number of smaller elements to the right
--------------------------------------------
Input:
[3, 4, 9, 6, 1]

Output:
[1, 1, 2, 1, 0]

Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new
array is the number of smaller elements to the right of that element in the
original input array.

The suggestion speed improvement is backwards through the list
and at each iteration maintain a sorted list of the elements seen
so far and see where the current elemrnt would fit in.

The place the element would fit into this sorted subset corresponds to the
number of items that are lower than it.

It involves the use of two functions, bisect.bisect_left() and
bisect.insort() the first of these gives the index an element
would be inserted into an array, while the second returns the
sorted array with the element added.
