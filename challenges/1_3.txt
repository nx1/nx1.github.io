Calculate Maximum subarray sum
------------------------------
Input:
[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]

Output:
137

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contigous subarray of
the array, in the example given the maximum sum is 41,14,-5,86 for a total of
137. 

If an array with all negative numbers is provided the result should be 0 as the
maximum sum would be taking no elements, although another valid option would be
just to return the smallest value in that array.

The maximum subarray problem arise in many fields such as genomic sequence
analysis and computer vision.  In computer vision for example, the
maximum-subarray algorithm are used on bitmap images to detect the brightest
area in an image.


The optical solution to this problem is known as Kadabe's Algorithm.

The algorithm works by iterating over the array and at each value and
calculating the maximum possible subarray sum that can be obtained to the left
of that value.
