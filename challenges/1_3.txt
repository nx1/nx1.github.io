Calculate Maximum subarray sum
------------------------------
Input:
[34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86]

Output:
137

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contigous subarray of
the array, in the example given the maximum sum is 41,14,-5,86 for a total of
137. 

If an array with all negative numbers is provided the result should be 0 as the
maximum sum would be taking no elements, although another valid option would be
just to return the smallest value in that array.
